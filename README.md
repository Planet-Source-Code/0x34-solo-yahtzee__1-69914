### Description

Updated Version 3.0.0.83: Solo Yahtzee is a single player graphically based Yahtzee game designed to be played on any Windows machine. It&#8217;s extremely easy to play and very addictive. The code is not commented (not much anyway) &#8211; my apologies.

This is the FINAL-FINAL updated version. Newly added features include: Sounds, Advanced High Score keeping, Intelligent auto-play assistant, and more. I've added an interesting session graphing function to monitor your game play. Enjoy!
